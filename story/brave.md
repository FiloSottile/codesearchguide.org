# How Brave uses code search

The [Brave](https://brave.com) team uses Sourcegraph.com for code search. They set up [code.brave.com](https://code.brave.com) to redirect to the [Sourcegraph.com page for their `brave/brave-core` repository](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/brave/brave-core). Brave is a fork of Chromium, which also [uses code search](chromium-android.md).
