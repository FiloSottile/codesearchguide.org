# How the Chromium and Android projects use code search

Since the Chromium and Android open-source projects are maintained by Google, they use publicly usable instances of Google's internal code search:

- [Chromium code search](https://source.chromium.org/chromium)
- [Android code search](https://cs.android.com/)

Google [surveyed Chromium contributors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LQxLk4E3lrb3fIsVKlANu_pUjnILteoWMMNiJQmqNVU/edit) on how they used code search. Here's what they found:

- *Chromium code search is critical to my work.* **98%** of developers agree.
- *What do you use code search for?* Top answers: search, cross-references, browsing, understanding, sharing, history. Quotes:
  - "This tool is as critical as the code review tool to me"
  - "Everything. Without it I would be nothing. ... I use it several times a minute while coding."
  - "Everything. I open a cs.chromium.org tab probably every 10 minutes or so."
  - "Everything! Browsing the codebase, refactoring, understanding history changes."
  - "Everything? Constantly? Chromium is hella complicated."
  - "Basically everything. It is how I understand the Chromium codebase."
  - "Everything! Crucial to learning an area of codebase."
