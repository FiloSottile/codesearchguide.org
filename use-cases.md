# How code search is used

Why do developers search code? What higher-level tasks does code search help with?

The categorization here is a rough attempt to answer these questions. As with any taxonomy, it's imperfect. Once you start using code search, you'll likely find yourself using it frequently (12x/day on average, according to [Google's study](story/google.md)) for many different tasks. You might just start thinking of code search as a way to answer questions throughout the day, or as an extension of your brain.

## Use cases

### Understanding code

### Dev onboarding

### Code reuse

### Finding and fixing vulnerabilities

### Incident response

## Others

A Google study identified [5 categories of responses to "What question are you trying to answer [with code search]?"](story/google.md):

- Example code needed (How)
- Exploring or reading code (What)
- Code localization (Where)
- Determine impact (Why)
- Metadata (Who and When)

A Facebook talk gave [5 use cases for code search](story/facebook.md):

- Changing code
- Exploring code
- Refactoring code
- Understanding code
- Debugging code

## Analogy to web search

Suppose someone had never heard of Google (or any other web search engine), and they asked you, "What do you use Google for?" How would you answer that question?

One way is to think of your last few Google searches. You tell them, "Well, I used Google to look up [Abraham Lincoln's birthday](https://www.google.com/search?q=abraham+lincoln%27s+birthday), a pasta marinara recipe, and the directions to a restaurant." The person walks away confused, thinking that Google is a tool for doing a few random things: looking up famous people's birthdays, finding recipes, and getting directions.

Instead, you might tell them, "It's a way to quickly answer any kind of question." The person would probably still walk away confused, since that's quite vague.

In reality, Google and other web search engines are so widely used that virtually nobody seriously asks "What do you use Google for?" New computer users are guided to web search engines gradually in many ways, from their operating system's search bars and assistant features, to their web browser's default homepages. It's universally accepted that web search engines are a necessary and standard part of using a computer.

Code search hasn't yet achieved that level of adoption and normalcy, but that seems to be changing in recent years.
